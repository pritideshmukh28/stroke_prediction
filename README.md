Brain Stroke Prediction:
This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset with the aim of predicting the occurrence of a stroke in patients. The dataset includes various features related to patients' health and lifestyle, including age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and gender." Each entry represents a unique patient, and the features capture various risk factors associated with stroke.

Tools and Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.

Imbalanced-learn: For handling class imbalance in the dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset we'll be using includes various features related to patients' health and lifestyle. Each row represents a unique patient and includes attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and gender. The dataset also includes a target variable 'stroke' representing the occurrence of a stroke.

Objective:
Our main objective is to develop a predictive model that can effectively forecast the occurrence of a stroke based on the provided features. By leveraging the power of Logistic Regression, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and predictive performance.

Domain Knowledge
age: This is the age of the patient. Age is a crucial factor in stroke prediction as the risk of stroke increases with age. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after the age of 55.

hypertension: This is a binary feature indicating whether the patient has hypertension (high blood pressure) or not. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can damage blood vessels, making them prone to blockage or rupture.

heart_disease: This binary feature indicates whether the patient has heart disease or not. Patients with heart diseases are at a higher risk of stroke as these conditions can lead to the formation of clots in the heart that can travel to the brain.

ever_married: This feature represents whether the patient is married or not. Although not a direct risk factor for stroke, marital status can be associated with lifestyle factors that influence stroke risk. For instance, married individuals might have different stress levels, physical activity patterns, or dietary habits compared to their unmarried counterparts.

work_type: This categorical feature describes the type of occupation of the patient. Certain occupations might be associated with higher stress levels or sedentary behavior, which can influence stroke risk.

Residence_type: This feature indicates whether the patient lives in a rural or urban area. The place of residence might be associated with stroke risk due to factors like access to healthcare, air quality, lifestyle habits, etc.

avg_glucose_level: This feature represents the average glucose level in the patient's blood. High blood glucose levels can damage blood vessels, leading to an increased risk of stroke.

bmi: This is the Body Mass Index of the patient, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can lead to or exacerbate conditions like hypertension, high blood glucose, and heart disease.

smoking_status: This categorical feature indicates whether the patient is a smoker, former smoker, or never smoked. Smoking can increase stroke risk as it can damage blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and reduce the amount of oxygen reaching the brain.

gender: This feature represents the gender of the patient. Gender can influence stroke risk due to biological differences and gender-specific lifestyle patterns.
